As humans, there are two scenarios where I would leave a Yelp Review – when the service is exceptionally good, or disastrous. There is no in between. There is no way in hell I’m gonna go through the effort of getting out my phone, uploading my pictures, and writing a small essay if I don’t feel strongly about a restaurant. 

A lot of the single dollar signed, 4.5+ starred restaurants optimize their star rating by reducing the possibility that the customer will have a negative interaction with staff. This means that these are mediocre restaurants with counter service restaurants with limited menus.

When we are talking about authentic, cheap eats – we need to look for a few “green flags” that can point to if the restaurant is good. 

## There are a lot of reviews talking about bad service.

Authentic cheap asian restaurants will not have good service – unless you are a white guy who can converse with the aunties in their language - they will love you in that case. If you see a bunch of 1 or 2 star Yelp restaurants pointing to “bad service” from a Karen from Santa Monica - you know its gonna be BOMB! The waiters at these restaurants might “not check in on you,” or be “rude.” But, it’s going to taste better.

FYI, if the reviews are complaining about the taste/flavor of the foods specifically - the food just might be really bad.  

## Menu is in the original language

Another telltale sign that you have landed yourself in an authentic restaurant is that the menu items - next to the english - have their original language printed. That means people from that culture actually go there. Bonus points if they have printed stickers to cover up the original price to reflect the price after inflation. Yelp and Google Reviews both usually have pictures of the menu for you to peruse. 

## Metal Teapots

In many asian cultures, tea is believed to aid in digestion and is a must for meals. Check that first, they do serve tea. Then, check what the teapot looks like. Authentic Chinese restaurants use metal teapots because they are easy to clean and impossible to break. This might be trickier to see in pictures from the reviews, but if you spot a metal teapot you know it's a good sign!

That’s it - go find yourself some bomb chili oil noodles, xiao long bao, or any other asian food that is authentic, cheap, and most importantly so so GOOD!
